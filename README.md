# Wumbo Compiler

This is a compiler that was designed and built as a class throughout my compilers course. This code comes from the code generation portion, the final project in the course.

The language we designed was called "Wumbo" and it is quite simple. Wumbo consists of defining and calling functions, simple arithmetic operations, and input/output capabilities. 

As this project was completed over the duration of a semester, we tackled different components of the compiler each week or two. For example, one week we built the grammar, the next the parser, and later on the semantic analyzer that allowed us to construct the abstract syntax tree.

Sym, SymTable, Wumbo.cup, Wumbo.jlex are all files that I implemented in these projects throughout the semester, but the code included here was given in the final project skeleton code. For this project, I implemented the "codgen" functions are each of the Node types in ast.java.
